## Coding Variables In JS

There are three ways to declare a variable in JS:

1. with the help of the `var` keyword.
2. with the help of the `let` keyword.
3. with the help of the `const` keyword.

[Example](./01.%20Introduction%20to%20Programming%20with%20JS/01.Declaring_a_variable.js)


## Use of `;` in code

The Js code will still run if you miss writing the `;` but it is considered as best practice to learn the best syntax practices.

## Rules for variable creation:

1. Variable can contain small alphabets, capital alphabets, digits, underscore `_`, and `$` is allowed.
2. Variables **can't** have space or any other special char like: `first var` OR `#firstVar` OR `@name = "Ravi"` ‚ùå.
3. We give meaningful names to your variables.
4. Variables name cannot start with a digit but it can have digits in between or at the last.
   Example: 0james = 10 ‚ùå but james0 = 10‚úÖ
