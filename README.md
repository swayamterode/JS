## Coding Variables In JS

There are three ways to declare a variable in JS:

1. with the help of the `var` keyword.
2. with the help of the `let` keyword.
3. with the help of the `const` keyword.

[Example](./01.%20Introduction%20to%20Programming%20with%20JS/01.Declaring_a_variable.js)

## Use of `;` in code

The Js code will still run if you miss writing the `;` but it is considered as best practice to learn the best syntax practices.

## Rules for variable creation

1. Variable can contain small alphabets, capital alphabets, digits, underscore `_`, and `$` is allowed.
2. Variables **can't** have space or any other special char like: `first var` OR `#firstVar` OR `@name = "Ravi"` ‚ùå.
3. We give meaningful names to your variables.
4. Variables name cannot start with a digit but it can have digits in between or at the last.
   Example: 0james = 10 ‚ùå but james0 = 10‚úÖ

## Showing data to the user

Displaying some value to the user will use `console.log()`. This is a built-in Function of JS.

This will take some input and it will display some output.

- We can pass direct value inside the `console.log()`  
  **Example:** `console.log(10)` will give us 10 as the output!

- We can even pass the variable to the `console.log()`
  **Example:** let num = 10;
  `console.log(num)` will give us 10 as the output because num is 10 stored in it

We can also pass multiple values to the console.log() which will print in the same line ‚ùóÔ∏è

Example:

```js
var name = "Swayam Terode";
console.log(12, name, "Pune");
```

Output:

12 Swayam Terode Pune

## DataTypes In JS Primitives and Non Primitives

**Primitve DataTypes:**

- Atomic DataTypes.

  Example: Number

**Non-Primitive DataTypes:**

- DataType which is a composition of some other types.

  Example: Objects

What values we can store in JS?

1. **Number**: `0`, `-324`, `234`, etc .....

2. **String**: Either "Swayam" OR 'Swayam' are the correct ways to declare a string. You can also use backtick ` `` `.

3. Boolean: True or False these technical keywords. In other words `0` or `1`
4. **Undefined**: This is keyword.

   This signifies that something which is not defined yet but may be in the future will be defined ü§î...

5. **Objects**: If we want to store the key-value pair then we use Objects. Here the key will be unique.

Example:

```js
//NUMBER
console.log("\nNumber DataType ‚¨áÔ∏è\n");
var num = 10;
console.log(num);

// STRING
// there are three ways to define string
console.log("\nString DataType ‚¨áÔ∏è\n");
var myName = `Swayam`;
console.log("Using backticks:", myName);
myName = "Akshay";
console.log("Using double quotes:", myName);
myName = "Kartik";
console.log("Using single quotes:", myName);

// BOOLEAN - true or false
console.log("\nBoolean DataType ‚¨áÔ∏è\n");
var time = "10pm";
if (time == "10pm") console.log(true);

var time = "1pm";
if (time == "10pm") console.log(true);
else console.log(false);

// UNDEFINED
console.log("\nnUnderstanding Undefined DataType ‚¨áÔ∏è\n");
var profession;
console.log(profession);

//OBJECTS
//acts as key-value pair‚ùóÔ∏è
console.log("\nUnderstanding Objects as Non-Primitive DataType ‚¨áÔ∏è\n");
var person = {
  name: "Swayam Terode",
  age: 21,
  gender: "Male",
  address: "üìçPune",
  college: "SPPU",
};
console.log(person);
```

Output:

![3.DataType](./01.%20Introduction%20to%20Programming%20with%20JS/consoleOutputs/03.DataTypes.png)

## Using Special characters

In Js, there are many special characters but the most commonly used special character are `\n` and `\t`.

- `\n`: This means the end of the line.
- `\t`: This provides 4 spaces to the text.

Example:

```js
var text = "My name is Swayam \nI'm from Pune";
console.log(text);
text = "My name is Swayam \tI'm from Pune";
console.log(text);
```

Output:

<img src="./01.%20Introduction%20to%20Programming%20with%20JS/consoleOutputs/04.SpecialChars.png" alt = "Special Char output"/>
